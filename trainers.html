            <p>"I went from a lazy, sickly, asthmatic kid to a college student that was still lazy, unhealthy, 
            and unmotivated. It wasn’t until 4 years after this picture that I decided to change my life. Now, 
            I am the opposite of what I use to be. I am motivated, inspired, and far from lazy. I live my 
            life trying to inspire and motivate others to do more and be more through diet, exercise, confidence 
            building, and anyway that I can. As a mother of 5 young men, I know time management is difficult. 
            In order to maximize your time, you have to understand your priorities, and I help people realize they should 
            be a priority."</p>
